# oth-chatbot
A hierarchical multi-agent chatbot for the OTH-AW University. A central orchestrator delegates user queries to specialized expert agents (e.g., library, IT support). This modular approach improves efficiency, speed, and reliability by using focused tools and smaller contexts, leading to more accurate and faster responses.
